      <div className="text-center mb-12">
        <p className="text-lg">
          The average human body contains about five liters of blood, which is made of several cellular and non-cellular components such as Red blood cells, Platelets, and Plasma.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg">
          Each type of component has its unique properties and can be used for different indications. The donated blood is separated into these components by the blood center, and one donated unit can save up to four lives, depending on the number of components separated from your blood.
        </p>

          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            <strong>What is it?</strong> Blood collected straight from the donor into a blood bag and mixed with an anticoagulant is called whole blood. This whole blood is then centrifuged to separate the red cells, platelets, and plasma. The separated red cells are mixed with a preservative to be called Packed Red Blood Cells.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            <strong>What is it?</strong> Plasma is the yellowish liquid portion of your blood that carries water, electrolytes, proteins, and waste products. It is collected through a process called plasmapheresis, where whole blood is drawn, and the plasma is separated and returned to the donor.

            <strong>Who can donate?</strong> Plasma donors should be between 18-65 years of age, weigh 50kg or more, and meet certain health criteria.

          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            <strong>What is it?</strong> Platelet donation is a process in which platelets are separated from your blood through a procedure called apheresis. The remaining components (red blood cells and plasma) are returned to your body.
